Capacity Planning for Filesystem Usage

**Understand Current Usage:**

Gather data on current filesystem usage, including total capacity, used space, and available space.
Use the following command to get filesystem usage information:

df -h /dev/mapper/vg_data-rke2
  
**Analyze Growth Trends:**

Review historical data on filesystem usage to identify any growth trends over time.
Use monitoring tools to track usage trends and identify any spikes or patterns.
  
**Forecast Future Usage:**

Based on the growth trends, forecast future filesystem usage for a defined period.
Use tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or similar monitoring tools to predict future usage based on historical data.
  
**Set Thresholds and Alarms:**

Define acceptable thresholds for filesystem usage based on historical data and projected growth.
Set up monitoring alerts to notify administrators when the usage approaches or exceeds the defined thresholds.
  
**Plan for Scaling and Expansion:**

Evaluate the possibility of scaling up the existing storage capacity to accommodate future growth.
Consider implementing storage expansion solutions such as adding new disks, increasing the size of the existing disks, or migrating to a larger storage solution.

**Implement Regular Review and Adjustment:**

Establish a regular review process to monitor the effectiveness of the capacity planning.
Adjust the thresholds and forecasting models based on new data and changes in the system's usage pattern.
  
**Automate Monitoring and Reporting:**

Automate the monitoring process to ensure continuous tracking of filesystem usage.
Generate regular reports on filesystem usage and growth trends for better decision-making.
  
**Periodic Review and Optimization:**

Conduct periodic reviews of the capacity planning strategy to ensure its relevance and effectiveness.
Optimize the capacity planning process based on the feedback from monitoring and analysis.

  
By following these steps, you can create a robust capacity planning strategy for managing filesystem usage effectively and efficiently. Adjust the steps according to your specific system requirements and organizational needs.
