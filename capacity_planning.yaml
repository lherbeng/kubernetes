High Load Average Metrics:

1. Analyze historical data trends of the node_load1 metric over a significant period to identify patterns and seasonal fluctuations.
2. Continuously monitor the performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk I/O, in addition to the load average.
3. Identify the target system that requires the CPU performance upgrade.
4. Send a request to the appropriate team for a CPU upgrade
5. Please provide justification for your request why do you need to upgrade the CPU.
6. Find a suitable time for the CPU upgrade that won't disturb the team members using the server.
7. Run the command 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' to check the number of available CPU cores and ensure that the requested upgrade has been implemented.
8. Conduct thorough testing to validate the successful implementation and to confirm that the expected performance gains have been achieved.

Filesystem usage metrics

1. Collect information about how we've used the disk over a long time, like many months or a whole year, so we can see how it's changed over different seasons and times.
2. Calculate how quickly the data and storage requirements are increasing by looking at the historical data over time.
3. Based on how fast things are growing and what we expect in the future, estimate how much storage we'll need in the coming months or years.
4. Plan to add more space or resources, like extra storage, because we expect things to grow, and we have a limit we don't want to cross.
5.
