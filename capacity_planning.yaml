High Load Average Metrics:

1. Analyze historical data trends of the node_load1 metric over a significant period to identify patterns and seasonal fluctuations.
2. Continuously monitor the performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk I/O, in addition to the load average.
3. Identify the target system that requires the CPU performance upgrade.
4. Send a request to the appropriate team for a CPU upgrade
5. Please provide justification for your request why do you need to upgrade the CPU.
6. Find a suitable time for the CPU upgrade that won't disturb the team members using the server.
7. Run the command 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' to check the number of available CPU cores and ensure that the requested upgrade has been implemented.
8. Conduct thorough testing to validate the successful implementation and to confirm that the expected performance gains have been achieved.
