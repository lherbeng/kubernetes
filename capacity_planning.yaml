High Load Average Metrics:

1. Analyze historical data trends of the node_load1 metric over a significant period to identify patterns and seasonal fluctuations.
2. Continuously monitor the performance metrics, including CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk I/O, in addition to the load average.
3. Identify the target system that requires the CPU performance upgrade.
4. Send a request to the appropriate team for a CPU upgrade
5. Please provide justification for your request why do you need to upgrade the CPU.
6. Find a suitable time for the CPU upgrade that won't disturb the team members using the server.
7. Run the command 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' to check the number of available CPU cores and ensure that the requested upgrade has been implemented.
8. Conduct thorough testing to validate the successful implementation and to confirm that the expected performance gains have been achieved.

Filesystem usage metrics

1. Collect information about how we've used the disk over a long time, like many months or a whole year, so we can see how it's changed over different seasons and times.
2. Calculate how quickly the data and storage requirements are increasing by looking at the historical data over time.
3. Based on how fast things are growing and what we expect in the future, estimate how much storage we'll need in the coming months or years.
4. Regularly check the files on the server and remove any that are no longer needed to free up space.
5. Plan to add more space or resources, like extra storage, because we expect things to grow, and we have a limit we don't want to cross.
6. Kindly request a disk upgrade from the appropriate team.
7.  Please provide justification for your request why do you need to upgrade the disk.
8. Identify a convenient time for the disk upgrade that won't disrupt the server users.
9. The command "df -Th" can be executed to verify the available disk space and confirm the completion of the requested upgrade.

Node memory high utilization metric

1. Check how the server is running to find which application or program are using a lot of memory. This can help you see where things can be made better.
2. Make sure your application or programare using your computer's resources efficiently. This might mean changing settings, how much memory different programs use, or using more efficient ways to handle data.
3. Use system monitoring tools like top to observe the memory usage of a specific process over an extended period
4. Keep an eye on how much memory your programs are using. Regularly checking can help you catch any slow increases in memory use that could cause problems over time.
5. Consider adding more memory to your server to manage the increased workload effectively. This upgrade can provide the necessary resources for improved performance and prevent slowdowns.
6. Kindly submit a request for memory upgrade from the appropriate team.
7. Please provide justification for your request why do you need to upgrade the RAM or memory.
8. Identify a convenient time for the RAM upgrade that won't disrupt the server users.
9. You can use the command "free -h" to check how much memory is available and confirm the completion of the requested upgrade.
