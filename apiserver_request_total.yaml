The expression you provided sum by (instance) (increase(apiserver_request_total{cluster="CLUSTER_NAME"}[1m])) is a PromQL query used in Prometheus, a popular open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit. This query is used to calculate the increase in the apiserver_request_total metric over a 1-minute time interval, summed by the instance label, where the cluster label is set to the specified cluster name.

To use this query with expression annotations and thresholds, you can set up alerts to trigger when certain conditions are met. Here's a basic guide on how to do that:

Setting up Prometheus Alerts:

---

groups:
- name: example
  rules:
  - alert: HighApiServerRequest
    expr: sum by (instance) (increase(apiserver_request_total{cluster="CLUSTER_NAME"}[1m])) > 1000
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: High API Server Requests on {{ $labels.instance }}
      description: "The API server requests on {{ $labels.instance }} are too high, indicating potential issues."
      value: "{{ $value }} API requests"

----

Expression annotations allow you to display the result of a PromQL expression as part of the annotation of an alert.
You can add them in the alerting rules to include relevant information in the alerts.
Thresholds:

Set thresholds based on the data and your application's requirements. These thresholds define the conditions that trigger the alerts.
You can set thresholds for metrics like the increase in API server requests to define when the system should generate an alert.
Here's an example of how you might set up an alert rule for your specific query:

---



groups:
- name: example
  rules:
  - alert: HighApiServerRequest
    expr: sum by (instance) (increase(apiserver_request_total{instance="INSTANCE_NAME"}[1m])) > 1000
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      summary: High API Server Requests on {{ $labels.instance }}
      description: "The API server requests on {{ $labels.instance }} are too high, indicating potential issues."
      value: "{{ $value }} API requests"

----

In this modified configuration, the alert rule checks if the sum of the API server requests for a specific instance exceeds 1000 over a 1-minute interval. If the condition is met, an alert will be triggered with the specified annotations and labels.

Make sure to replace INSTANCE_NAME with the actual instance you want to monitor. Adjust the threshold and the duration (for parameter) according to your specific requirements and the characteristics of your system. Adjust the severity and other annotations as needed to provide the necessary context for the alert.
