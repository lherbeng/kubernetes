          description: "The API server request duration has been high for the last 5 minutes."



In this alerting rule, when the API server request duration sum increases by more than 10 seconds over the last 5 minutes continuously, a warning alert will be triggered. You can adjust the threshold (the > 10 part) and the duration (for: 5m) according to your specific performance requirements and tolerance for high request durations.
