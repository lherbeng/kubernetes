## NodeMemoryHighUtilization 

Meaning: 

This issue indicates that the memory usage on the node has reached a high level, possibly leading to performance degradation or failure of applications running on the node.

Impact: 

High memory utilization can cause system slowdowns, application crashes, and overall degradation in the performance of the node.

**Diagnosis**

- Use the free -m command to check the current memory usage:

**Other things to check:**

- Check if any memory leaks are occurring in any specific application or service.
- Monitor the memory usage over time to identify any trends or patterns.

**Mitigation:**

- Identify and terminate any unnecessary processes or services consuming excessive memory.
Implement memory optimization techniques for resource-heavy applications.
Consider upgrading the hardware or increasing the memory capacity of the node if the issue persists.
