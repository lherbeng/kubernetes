Meaning

High CPU usage in a Node application indicates that the application is consuming more processing power than expected, potentially leading to performance degradation and increased operational costs.

Impact

High CPU usage in a Node service can lead to slower response times for users, reduced server capacity for handling additional requests, and increased operational costs due to higher resource consumption.

Diagnosis

- Identify the process causing high CPU usage using top command
- Review the hardware resources using "lscpu" to ensure that the server meets the application's requirements.
