## nodecpuhighusage

Meaning

High CPU usage in a Node application indicates that the application is consuming more processing power than expected, potentially leading to performance degradation and increased operational costs.

Impact

High CPU usage in a Node service can lead to slower response times for users, reduced server capacity for handling additional requests, and increased operational costs due to higher resource consumption.

Diagnosis

- Identify the process causing high CPU usage using top command
- Review the hardware resources using "lscpu" to ensure that the server meets the application's requirements.
- 

OTher things to check

- Analyze the network traffic for any unexpected spikes or increased data transfer using "sudo tcpdump -i eth0"
- 

Mitigation

- Implement code optimizations, such as reducing unnecessary computations and improving algorithm efficiency.
- Utilize caching mechanisms to reduce redundant computations and database queries.
- Consider horizontal scaling by distributing the workload across multiple instances.
- Use monitoring tools to set up alerts for abnormal CPU usage and performance degradation.
