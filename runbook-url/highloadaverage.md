## HighLoadAverage

Meaning: High load average means the system is getting more work requests than it can manage.

Impact: High load can make the system slow, unresponsive, and may even stop some services from working.

** Diagnosis: **

- Check the current load average using the command: uptime.
- Identify resource-hungry processes with: top and inspect for any processes consuming excessive CPU or memory.
- Analyze system logs for any error messages or warnings that may provide insights into the root cause.
  
** Other things to check: **

- Monitor disk I/O using: iostat to identify if any process is leading to excessive disk activity.
- Check network usage using: netstat to detect any unusual network traffic.
- Review the memory usage using: free -m to assess whether memory constraints contribute to the high load.

  
** Mitigation: **

- Terminate any processes consuming excessive resources. To terminate a process, use the command: kill <PID> (replace <PID> with the process ID of the resource-intensive process).
- Optimize the code or application for better performance.
- Consider upgrading hardware if the high load persists and affects system performance.
