## HighLoadAverage

Meaning: High load average means the system is getting more work requests than it can manage.

Impact: High load can make the system slow, unresponsive, and may even stop some services from working.

** Diagnosis: **

- Check the current load average using the command: uptime.
- Identify resource-hungry processes with: top and inspect for any processes consuming excessive CPU or memory.
- Analyze system logs for any error messages or warnings that may provide insights into the root cause.

- System Log (syslog):

Command to view the syslog: cat /var/log/syslog or tail /var/log/syslog
Location: /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages

- Application Logs:

Command to view application logs: It depends on the specific application. For example, for Apache web server, you might use sudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log to view the error log.
Location: Application logs can vary in location based on the application's configuration. Common locations include /var/log/ directory or a subdirectory specific to the application.

- Security Logs:

Command to view security logs: sudo cat /var/log/auth.log or sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
Location: /var/log/auth.log or /var/log/secure

- Kernel Logs:

Command to view kernel logs: sudo dmesg or sudo cat /var/log/kern.log
Location: /var/log/kern.log or output from the dmesg command.
Database Logs (if applicable):

Command and location depend on the specific database system. For example, for MySQL, you might use sudo tail -f /var/log/mysql/error.log to view the MySQL error log.
  
** Other things to check: **

- Monitor disk I/O using: iostat to identify if any process is leading to excessive disk activity.
- Check network usage using: netstat to detect any unusual network traffic.
- Review the memory usage using: free -m to assess whether memory constraints contribute to the high load.

  
** Mitigation: **

- Terminate any processes consuming excessive resources. To terminate a process, use the command: kill <PID> (replace <PID> with the process ID of the resource-intensive process).
- Optimize the code or application for better performance.
- Consider upgrading hardware if the high load persists and affects system performance.
