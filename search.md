**Capacity planning is a crucial aspect of managing IT infrastructure, and it involves ensuring that your systems have enough resources to handle current and future workloads efficiently. When you receive an alert in Grafana indicating that your disk usage has reached 85 percent, it's a signal that you should start considering capacity planning measures to prevent potential issues such as system slowdowns, outages, or data loss.

Here are steps you can take when you reach 85 percent disk usage in Grafana:

- Investigate the Cause: Before taking any action, it's important to understand why your disk usage is reaching this threshold. Check Grafana dashboards and logs to identify which specific services or applications are responsible for the increased disk usage. This information will help you target your capacity planning efforts effectively.

- Analyze Historical Data: Examine historical disk usage trends to determine if this increase is a temporary spike or a sustained pattern. This will help you differentiate between short-term capacity issues and long-term growth trends.

- Add More Storage: If you find that your disk usage is growing due to legitimate data and application needs, consider adding more storage capacity to your system. This might involve expanding existing disks, adding new disks, or provisioning cloud-based storage solutions.

- Optimize Data: Evaluate if there is any unnecessary data occupying disk space. Implement data retention policies and regularly clean up or archive data that is no longer needed. Data compression and deduplication techniques can also be useful for optimizing disk space usage.

- Scale Vertically or Horizontally: Depending on your system architecture, you might need to scale your infrastructure. Vertical scaling involves upgrading individual components (e.g., increasing RAM or CPU), while horizontal scaling involves adding more servers or nodes to distribute the workload.

- Implement Monitoring and Alerts: Enhance your monitoring and alerting system to provide earlier warnings before reaching critical disk usage levels. This will allow you to take proactive measures and prevent the situation from becoming critical.

- Automate Scaling: Implement automation scripts or tools that can automatically scale your infrastructure up or down based on predefined thresholds. This can help maintain optimal resource utilization.

- Regularly Review and Adjust: Capacity planning is an ongoing process. Continuously monitor your system's performance and disk usage patterns, and adjust your capacity planning strategy as needed.

- Consider Cloud-Based Solutions: If you're in a cloud environment, take advantage of cloud-based services that offer dynamic scaling options. Cloud providers often offer tools to automatically adjust resources in response to changing workloads.

- Plan for Disaster Recovery: Ensure you have robust backup and disaster recovery plans in place to protect your data in case of unexpected capacity issues, such as disk failures or data corruption.

Capacity planning should be a proactive and iterative process, as it helps you avoid unexpected downtime and performance bottlenecks. The specific actions you take will depend on your infrastructure, application requirements, and business needs. Always monitor your system's performance and make adjustments as necessary to ensure optimal resource utilization and reliability.

For CPU usage, you can use a query like this:

(1 - (avg_over_time(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]) / ignoring(mode) avg_over_time(node_cpu_seconds_total[5m]))) * 100 > 85

For memory usage, you can use a query like this:

(node_memory_MemTotal - node_memory_MemFree - node_memory_Buffers - node_memory_Cached) / node_memory_MemTotal * 100 > 85

This query calculates the used memory as a percentage of the total memory and checks if it's greater than 85%.

Create an Alert Rule in Grafana:

In your Grafana dashboard, navigate to the panel where you want to set up the alert.

Click on the panel title and select "Edit."

In the panel editor, go to the "Alert" tab.

Click on the "Create Alert" button to define a new alert rule.

Configure the Alert Rule:

Give your alert rule a name and a description for clarity.

Set the evaluation interval to an appropriate value, such as 1m (1 minute).

Under "Conditions," set the query you created in step 1 for either CPU or memory, depending on which resource you are monitoring.

Set the "Condition" to "Is Above" and the "Threshold" to 85.

Configure the "For" field to specify how long the condition should be met before triggering the alert. For example, set it to 2m if you want the condition to persist for 2 minutes before alerting.

Define Alerting Settings:

In the "Notifications" section, configure the notification channel(s) where you want to receive alerts. This could be Slack, email, or any other supported notification method.

Set up any additional notification settings as needed, such as message templates and severity.

Save the Alert Rule:

Click "Save" to save the alert rule.
Test the Alert:

To ensure that the alert is working as expected, you can trigger it manually by temporarily modifying your Prometheus data or by simulating high resource usage on a node.
Enable the Alert:

Once you've confirmed that the alert is functioning correctly, you can enable it by clicking the "Enabled" toggle in the alert rule settings.
With this configuration, Grafana will trigger an alert when the CPU or memory usage on a node exceeds 85% for the specified duration. You can customize the threshold, evaluation interval, and notification channels to suit your specific monitoring and alerting needs.
