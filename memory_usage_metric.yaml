"Urgent Notice: Memory Usage Alert! üö® Memory at {{ $labels.instance }} has exceeded 85% for the last 15 minutes. Please take immediate action."




"Critical Alert: High CPU Usage ‚ö†Ô∏è - {{ $labels.instance }} has consistently exceeded 85% for the past 15 minutes. Take action now!"

In the top command, there are specific fields and information you can check to monitor CPU usage as a percentage. Here are some key details to focus on when using the top command for CPU monitoring:

us (User): This is the percentage of CPU time spent running user processes, which are typically the most relevant for applications.

sy (System): This is the percentage of CPU time spent running system processes, which are the kernel and other essential system tasks.

ni (Nice): This is the percentage of CPU time spent running processes with a positive nice value, indicating processes that have been niced (lower priority).

id (Idle): This is the percentage of CPU time when the CPU is idle and not processing any tasks.

wa (I/O Wait): This is the percentage of CPU time spent waiting for I/O operations to complete.

st (Steal): This is the percentage of CPU time stolen from a virtual machine (if you're using virtualization).

%CPU (CPU Usage): The %CPU column represents the percentage of total CPU time that a process is using. You can sort the processes by CPU usage to identify which processes are consuming the most CPU resources.

Load Average: The load average section at the top of the top output provides an overview of the system's overall load over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes. A high load average may indicate high CPU usage.

When you run the top command, it displays a dynamic list of running processes sorted by one of the columns (default is usually by %CPU). You can observe the processes with the highest %CPU values to identify which processes are currently consuming the most CPU resources.
