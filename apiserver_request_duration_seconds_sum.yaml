In this example, the Prometheus alerting rule checks if the rate of apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum over a 5-minute period is greater than 0.5 seconds. You can adjust the threshold value as needed based on your specific use case and requirements. The for parameter specifies the duration for which the condition should be true before triggering the alert. Adjust the severity, summary, and description labels and annotations according to your alerting policies and conventions.

Make sure to integrate this rule configuration into your Prometheus configuration file, typically located at prometheus.yml. After updating the configuration file, you will need to reload or restart Prometheus to apply the changes.

The query sum(rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])) by (verb) > 0.5 is used to monitor the request latency of the kube-apiserver and trigger an alert if the request duration exceeds a predefined threshold. Here's the breakdown of this query:

sum(rate(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])) by (verb): This part of the query calculates the per-second average rate of change of the apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum metric over a 5-minute window, grouped by the verb label. It provides information on the rate of increase in the request duration over time, allowing you to analyze which types of requests are experiencing high latency.

> 0.5: This part of the query sets the threshold at 0.5 seconds. If the calculated rate exceeds 0.5 seconds, indicating that the request latency is higher than the defined threshold, the condition evaluates to true.

When the query evaluates to true for the specified duration (as indicated by the for parameter in the alerting rule), it triggers an alert. The purpose of this query is to proactively monitor and detect any significant increases in kube-apiserver request latency, which can help you identify potential performance issues and take necessary actions to resolve them before they impact the overall system performance or user experience.

For some applications or services, a latency of 500 milliseconds might be acceptable, while for others, it might be considered too high. The choice of threshold value should be based on your system's performance targets, user expectations, and the nature of the applications running on the Kubernetes cluster.

Consider the following factors when determining an appropriate latency threshold:

Service Level Objectives (SLOs): Define your service-level objectives, including acceptable latency levels, based on the specific requirements of your application and the expectations of your users.

Application Requirements: Consider the specific requirements of your applications. Some applications might demand lower latencies for optimal performance, while others might be more tolerant of slight delays.

User Experience: Assess the impact of latency on the overall user experience. For certain applications, even a slight delay might significantly affect user satisfaction and engagement.

System Load and Capacity: Take into account the load on your system and the capacity of your infrastructure. Higher loads might lead to increased latency, so your threshold should be set accordingly to ensure optimal performance under varying loads.

Industry Standards and Best Practices: Refer to industry standards and best practices for similar applications or services to get a better understanding of what constitutes acceptable latency in your domain.

apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum

Certainly, to reduce noise and improve the effectiveness of the alert based on the increase(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) > 10 query, you can consider implementing the following adjustments:

Smoothing and Aggregation: Instead of directly alerting on the rate of increase, you can use functions such as avg_over_time() or irate() to smooth out the variations in the data and aggregate the values over a specific time range. This can help in identifying genuine trends rather than reacting to short-term fluctuations.

Threshold Adjustment: Adjust the threshold value (10 in this case) to a more appropriate level based on the normal operating behavior of your system. Set the threshold to a value that represents a significant deviation from the usual patterns, indicating a potential performance issue.

Historical Analysis: Analyze historical data to understand the typical range and fluctuations in the rate of increase. Use this information to set a threshold that reflects an abnormal increase beyond the expected variations.

Additional Conditions and Filters: Apply additional conditions or filters to the alerting rule to consider the context of the system and filter out transient spikes that do not last for a significant duration.

In this adjusted version, the query applies a 2-minute averaging window to smooth out short-term fluctuations. The threshold for triggering the alert is set to 5, and the condition must persist for at least 10 minutes before the alert is fired. Adjust the parameters further as needed to align with your system's behavior and performance expectations.

The expressions avg_over_time(increase(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])[2m]) > 5 and increase(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) > 10 both monitor the rate of change for the duration of requests handled by the kube-apiserver. However, they use different approaches for calculation and evaluation, leading to differences in how they detect and handle changes in the metric. Here's an explanation of each:

avg_over_time(increase(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m])[2m]) > 5:

This expression calculates the average rate of change over 5 minutes (as indicated by the [5m] range in apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum) and then further smooths the data by averaging it over a 2-minute window ([2m] range). The threshold is set to 5, meaning that if the smoothed average rate of increase exceeds 5, an alert will be triggered.
increase(apiserver_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) > 10:

This expression directly measures the rate of increase in the duration of requests over a 5-minute period. If the increase in the metric is greater than 10 within that time frame, an alert is triggered.
The key distinction between the two lies in how they handle variations and spikes in the data. The first expression smooths out short-term fluctuations, providing a more stable and averaged view of the rate of change. On the other hand, the second expression directly looks for a significant increase without considering short-term fluctuations.

The choice between the two approaches depends on your specific requirements, the expected behavior of the metric, and the level of noise you're willing to tolerate in your alerts. Adjust the parameters based on the characteristics of your system and the desired sensitivity to changes in the metric.
